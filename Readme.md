# Tokenized Skill Tree Progression

## Project Description
The Tokenized Skill Tree Progression project is a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to earn tokens as they progress through different skill levels. Each level up in the skill tree rewards users with tokens, providing an incentive to continue learning and improving their skills. The smart contract handles the progression, rewards, and token transfers between users.
